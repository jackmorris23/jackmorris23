### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**jackmorris23/jackmorris23** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

- I have no previous coding experience. 
- I am taking this class because I am interested in learning more about computers and why they are able to work. I also hope this course strengthens my college applications. 
- Academically, I am interested in math, which I hope to use to become an engineer. I also am interested in learning to speak fluent Spanish. I like many sports; mainly basketball, soccer, and baseball. 
- My goal from this class is to gain an understanding of how to code as well as get a better understanding of the engineering behind computers. I do not have a specific project on my mind right now, but I am excited to understand more about coding.
